Implement File Handling:
    * Read file line-by-line to file buffer
    * Write entire file buffer to file on disk, overwritting the file

Implement writing file contents to screen:
    * Write however many lines to the ncurses
      screen as there is space for (i.e. if ncurses screen is 20 lines tall,
      write 20 lines to the screen)
    * Keep track of the first and the last line displayed, when the text
      is scrolled past the end of the window, write the next or previous
      line from the buffer to the screen
